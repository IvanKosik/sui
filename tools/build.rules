# Rule builder is a tool for building repository by definde rules.
# For this moment it support folowing rules:
# * scg rules. They used for building *.scg files, that will be used for segment building.
# 	Example:
#		scg:> seb/plan -> seb/planimet
#	In this example all files from seb/plan directory and all subdirectories will be added to 
#	file seb/planimet.scg.
# * include rules. They used to add including directive to files.
# 	Example:
#		inc:> beg "seb/planimet.scg" <- "test.scsy"
#	In this example #include "test.scsy" directive will be added at the begining of seb/planimetry.scg file.
# * gwfkey rule. Used for parse keynodes from gwf file and append them into scsy file.
#	Example:
#		gwfkey:> "etc/com_keynodes_src/com_keynodes.gwf" -> "include/_keynodes.scsy" "/etc/com_keynodes"
#	In that example all keynodes from file "etc/com_keynodes_src/com_keynodes.gwf" will be added into 
#	"include/_keynodes.scsy" file. "/etc/com_keynodes" - segment, where kenodes locate.
# example 

# core KB
scg:> "info" -> "info"
#scg:> "main/ui" -> "main/ui"
#scg:> "main/etc" -> "main/etc"
scg:> "main" -> "main"


# keynodes
new:> "include/_keynodes.scsy"
inc:> beg "include/_keynodes.scsy" <- "ordinal.scsy"
gwfkey:> "main/ui/_keynodes.gwf" -> "include/_keynodes.scsy" "/main"
gwfkey:> "info/_keynodes.gwf" -> "include/_keynodes.scsy" "/info"
gwfkey:> "main/etc/_keynodes.gwf" -> "include/_keynodes.scsy" "/main"
